					<li><b>Environmental Crises Mitigation</b><br><br>
						<p>Whether it is air pollution, the depletion of the ozone layer, vast quantities of toxic waste, massive levels of soil erosion, the possible exhaustion of key natural sources such as oil and coal or even the extinction of plants and animals on a phenomenal scale, all these have lead to catastrophic events and will cause even more disastrous incidents to occur. Environmental disasters like global warming, deforestation, resource depletion all need to be averted and plans need to be devised so as to mitigate these issues. <br>

						The projects under this theme should be related to measures to be undertaken or techniques that can be implemented so that we can lessen the gravity of environmental crises that are proliferating all around.  Technical or business ideas and solutions linked to protecting the environment should be showcased for this topic. <br>

						Your team can give a paper presentation, a poster presentation or even a model on this topic.</p>

					</li>

					<li><b>Sustainable Development</b><br><br>
						<p>The ever-growing needs of man and the limited resources available which are being exploited would certainly lead to a grim future for the human race as we know it. Adopting new technological methods and managing resources in an efficient and judicious manner is the need of the hour. Such an approach for global developmental activities which fulfils the wants of human beings and also preserves natural resources for the future generations as well as the present generation would be called as sustainable development. <br>

						The projects to be made under this theme should be associated to the topics of sustainable development. Projects can provide technical or business solutions to population stabilization, conservation of bio diversity, development of non polluting renewable energy resources, recycling of wastes and resources or any other such activity. <br>

						Your team can give a paper presentation, a poster presentation or even a model under this theme.</p>
					</li>

					<li><b>Environmental Engineering</b><br><br>
						<p>Environmental engineering is that branch of engineering which deals with the protecting of people from the effects of adverse environmental issues like pollution, sanitation, waste disposal, etc. as well as improving the environmental quality. It is the combination of technological developments and green ideas that help in making our surroundings a better place to live in. <br>

						The projects under this theme must depict ideas that improve the natural surroundings through the use of a working model. Projects on topics like waste water management, air pollution control, recycling, waste disposal, radiation protection, industrial hygiene and environmental sustainability can be made.<br>

						Your team has to make a working 3-D model under this theme which will then be showcased.</p>
